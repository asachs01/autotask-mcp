# Story 1.5: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation

## Story
As a developer ensuring system reliability,
I want comprehensive tests covering both transport types,
so that regressions are caught and deployment confidence is high.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit tests updated for SDK v1.18.0 compatibility
2. Integration tests for HTTP transport functionality
3. Cross-transport test suite ensuring feature parity
4. README.md updated with HTTP transport setup instructions
5. Environment variable documentation updated
6. Performance benchmarks for both transport types

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Full test suite passes for both stdio and HTTP modes
- **IV2**: Existing integration scripts work without modification
- **IV3**: Documentation accurately reflects actual implementation behavior

## Tasks
- [ ] Update unit tests for SDK v1.18.0 compatibility
- [ ] Create HTTP transport integration tests
- [ ] Add cross-transport feature parity tests
- [ ] Update README.md with HTTP transport documentation
- [ ] Document new environment variables
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for both transports
- [ ] Update developer documentation

## Dev Notes
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all transport combinations
- Documentation should include examples and troubleshooting
- Performance benchmarks help validate no degradation

## Testing
- [ ] Full test suite passes (unit + integration)
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable metrics
- [ ] Documentation accuracy verification
