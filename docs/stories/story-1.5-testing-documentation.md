# Story 1.5: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation

## Story
As a developer ensuring system reliability,
I want comprehensive tests covering both transport types,
so that regressions are caught and deployment confidence is high.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit tests updated for SDK v1.18.0 compatibility (address ts-jest warnings as needed).
2. Smithery-hosted smoke tests cover Streamable HTTP behaviour (tools/resources, progress, optional SSE).
3. Cross-transport (stdio vs. hosted) regression plan established to ensure parity.
4. Documentation updated with Smithery deployment guidance, environment expectations, and troubleshooting.
5. Credential-gated tests either supplied with fixtures/mocks or clearly gated via configuration.
6. Performance/latency expectations captured for both local stdio and hosted deployments (even if lightweight benchmarks).

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Full test suite passes for both stdio and HTTP modes
- **IV2**: Existing integration scripts work without modification
- **IV3**: Documentation accurately reflects actual implementation behavior

## Tasks
- [x] Update unit tests for SDK v1.18.0 compatibility (ts-jest config warnings remain)
- [ ] Add Smithery-hosted smoke test (manual script or automated) covering Streamable HTTP
- [ ] Add cross-transport parity checklist/tests (stdio vs. hosted)
- [x] Update README.md with transport documentation *(needs Smithery-specific expansion)*
- [x] Document environment/config expectations across guides (README, developer guide, release notes)
- [ ] Address credential-gated `basic-autotask-connection` test (mocks or gating strategy)
- [ ] Capture lightweight performance metrics for local vs. hosted runs

## Dev Notes
- Hosted smoke tests can begin as manual walkthroughs but should be scripted where practical.
- Documentation must clearly distinguish between local stdio usage and Smithery-hosted flows.
- Performance expectations can be simple latency observations; no heavy benchmarking required initially.

## Testing
- [ ] Full test suite passes (unit + integration) *(blocked by credential-gated connection test and missing hosted smoke tests)*
- [ ] Smithery smoke test documented/executable *(pending)*
- [ ] Performance/latency spot-checks recorded *(not started)*
- [ ] Documentation review against latest behaviour *(pending developer guide / testing instructions refresh)*

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Update unit tests for SDK v1.18.0 compatibility (tests compile and run under ts-jest 29.x)
- [x] Update README.md with initial transport documentation (Transport Modes section)
- [ ] Add Smithery-hosted smoke test *(outstanding)*
- [ ] Add cross-transport feature parity tests *(outstanding)*
- [x] Document new environment variables & Smithery session expectations *(README + developer guide updated; release notes pending)*
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for local vs. hosted transports
- [ ] Update developer documentation assets

### Debug Log References
- Jest run on 2025-09-16: `tests/basic-autotask-connection.test.ts` fails without live Autotask credentials; other suites pass.
- ts-jest emits deprecation warning for globals configuration (needs follow-up).

### Completion Notes
- README now includes a "Deploying via Smithery" section outlining config prompts, smoke test workflow, and hosted vs. local transport guidance.
- Developer guide mirrors the Smithery workflow with curl-based verification steps and reiterates credential prerequisites; release notes/testing docs still require alignment.
- Test suite compiles but requires live credentials for connection smoke test; consider mocking Autotask client or gating via env flag.
- Hosted smoke tests, cross-transport parity checks, and performance snapshots remain outstanding pending Smithery connectivity.

### File List
- README.md (transport documentation)
- docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE_MCP_AUTOTASK.md (Smithery deployment guidance)
- tests/transport.test.ts (added during Story 1.2; referenced here for coverage)

### Change Log
- 2025-09-15: README updated with HTTP transport quick start.
- 2025-09-16: Captured outstanding test/documentation tasks post-upgrade.
- 2025-09-17: Story refocused on Smithery-hosted smoke tests and documentation alignment.

## Status
In Progress
