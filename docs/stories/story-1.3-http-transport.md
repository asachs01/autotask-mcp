# Story 1.3: HTTP Transport Implementation

## Story
As a developer enabling remote MCP connections,
I want to implement HTTP transport alongside stdio,
so that clients can connect remotely via HTTP POST and SSE.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. HTTP transport class implemented following MCP specification
2. HTTP POST endpoint for client-to-server messages
3. Server-Sent Events (SSE) support for server-to-client streaming
4. Port and host configuration via environment variables
5. Basic HTTP authentication support
6. Graceful startup/shutdown for HTTP server

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Stdio transport remains completely unaffected
- **IV2**: HTTP and stdio can run simultaneously without conflicts
- **IV3**: Server resource usage scales appropriately with transport load

## Tasks
- [ ] Create HTTP transport class following MCP specification
- [ ] Implement HTTP POST endpoint for client messages
- [ ] Add Server-Sent Events (SSE) support
- [ ] Add HTTP server configuration (port, host)
- [ ] Implement basic HTTP authentication
- [ ] Add graceful HTTP server startup/shutdown
- [ ] Integrate HTTP transport with abstraction layer

## Dev Notes
- Follow MCP HTTP transport specification closely
- Ensure HTTP and stdio can run simultaneously
- Basic auth should be configurable but optional

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for HTTP transport
- [ ] Integration tests with both transports running
- [ ] HTTP endpoint functionality tests
- [ ] SSE streaming tests
