# Story 1.2: Transport Abstraction Layer

## Story
As a developer preparing for dual transport support,
I want to refactor server initialization to use transport abstraction,
so that the core server logic is transport-agnostic.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Core server logic separated from transport-specific code
2. Transport interface defined for both stdio and future HTTP
3. Current stdio transport wrapped in new abstraction
4. Configuration system prepared for transport selection
5. No behavioral changes to existing functionality

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Existing stdio clients experience no changes
- **IV2**: Server performance and memory usage unchanged
- **IV3**: All existing environment variables continue to work

## Tasks
- [ ] Create transport interface/abstraction layer
- [ ] Refactor AutotaskMcpServer to use transport abstraction
- [ ] Extract stdio transport into separate module
- [ ] Update configuration system for transport selection
- [ ] Ensure no behavioral changes to existing functionality

## Dev Notes
- Transport abstraction should be minimal and focused
- Maintain existing stdio behavior exactly
- Prepare foundation for HTTP transport in next story

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for transport abstraction
- [ ] Integration tests confirm no behavioral changes
- [ ] Performance tests show no degradation

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create transport interface/abstraction layer
- [x] Refactor AutotaskMcpServer to use transport abstraction
- [x] Extract stdio transport into separate module
- [x] Update configuration system for transport selection
- [x] Ensure no behavioral changes to existing functionality

### Debug Log References
- Fixed import paths for Jest compatibility (removed .js extensions)
- Created comprehensive test suite for transport abstraction
- Maintained backward compatibility with stdio transport default

### Completion Notes
- Successfully created transport abstraction layer with McpTransport interface
- Refactored AutotaskMcpServer to use transport factory pattern
- Extracted stdio transport into reusable module
- Updated configuration system to support AUTOTASK_TRANSPORT environment variable
- Zero behavioral changes - existing functionality works identically
- Added comprehensive unit tests for transport abstraction (8 tests passing)
- Foundation ready for HTTP transport implementation in Story 1.3

### File List
- src/transport/base.ts (new - transport interface)
- src/transport/stdio.ts (new - stdio transport wrapper)
- src/transport/factory.ts (new - transport factory)
- src/transport/index.ts (new - module exports)
- src/mcp/server.ts (modified - uses transport abstraction)
