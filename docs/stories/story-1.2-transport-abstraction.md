# Story 1.2: Transport Abstraction Layer

## Story
As a developer preparing for dual transport support,
I want to refactor server initialization to use transport abstraction,
so that the core server logic is transport-agnostic.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Core server logic separated from transport-specific code
2. Transport interface defined for both stdio and future HTTP
3. Current stdio transport wrapped in new abstraction
4. Configuration system prepared for transport selection
5. No behavioral changes to existing functionality

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Existing stdio clients experience no changes
- **IV2**: Server performance and memory usage unchanged
- **IV3**: All existing environment variables continue to work

## Tasks
- [x] Create transport interface/abstraction layer
- [x] Refactor AutotaskMcpServer to use transport abstraction
- [x] Extract stdio transport into separate module
- [x] Update configuration system for transport selection
- [x] Ensure no behavioral changes to existing functionality (verified via stdio smoke tests)

## Dev Notes
- Transport abstraction should be minimal and focused
- Maintain existing stdio behavior exactly
- Prepare foundation for HTTP transport in next story

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests for transport abstraction (`tests/transport.test.ts`)
- [ ] Integration tests confirm no behavioral changes *(pending automated HTTP/stdio dual-run test)*
- [ ] Performance tests show no degradation *(not yet executed)*

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create transport interface/abstraction layer
- [x] Refactor AutotaskMcpServer to use transport abstraction
- [x] Extract stdio transport into separate module
- [x] Update configuration system for transport selection
- [x] Ensure no behavioral regressions in stdio mode (manual smoke test)

### Debug Log References
- Fixed import paths for Jest compatibility (removed .js extensions)
- Created comprehensive test suite for transport abstraction
- Maintained backward compatibility with stdio transport default

### Completion Notes
- Added `BaseTransport`, `StdioTransport`, and `TransportFactory` modules to decouple transport concerns.
- Updated `AutotaskMcpServer` to delay transport instantiation until `start()` while preserving existing lifecycle callbacks.
- `loadEnvironmentConfig` now emits transport settings; additional validation still needed for mismatched defaults (Smithery vs env loader).
- Unit suite passes; integration/performance verification deferred to Story 1.3/1.5 follow-up.

### File List
- src/transport/base.ts (new - transport interface)
- src/transport/stdio.ts (new - stdio transport wrapper)
- src/transport/factory.ts (new - transport factory)
- src/transport/index.ts (new - module exports)
- src/mcp/server.ts (modified - uses transport abstraction)
- src/utils/config.ts (modified - added transport configuration)
- src/index.ts (modified - passes transport config to server)
- tests/transport.test.ts (new - comprehensive transport tests)

### Change Log
- 2025-09-15: Created transport abstraction layer with McpTransport interface
- 2025-09-15: Implemented StdioTransport wrapper maintaining exact existing behavior
- 2025-09-15: Added TransportFactory for creating transport instances
- 2025-09-15: Updated configuration system with AUTOTASK_TRANSPORT environment variable
- 2025-09-15: Refactored AutotaskMcpServer to use transport abstraction
- 2025-09-15: Added comprehensive test suite for transport functionality

## Status
Ready for Review (pending integration/performance validation tracked in Stories 1.3 & 1.5)
