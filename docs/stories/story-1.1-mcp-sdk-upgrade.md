# Story 1.1: MCP SDK Upgrade Foundation

## Story
As a developer maintaining the Autotask MCP server,
I want to upgrade from MCP SDK v1.12.1 to v1.18.0,
so that the server uses the latest SDK features and security improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Package.json updated to MCP SDK v1.18.0
2. All existing functionality works with new SDK version
3. New SDK features (like "_meta" field support) are available
4. Build process completes without errors
5. All existing tests pass with new SDK

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Existing stdio transport continues to work without changes
- **IV2**: Autotask API integration functions identically to current version
- **IV3**: Server startup and shutdown processes remain unchanged

## Tasks
- [ ] Update package.json to MCP SDK v1.18.0
- [ ] Resolve any breaking changes from SDK upgrade
- [ ] Update imports and type definitions as needed
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality works
- [ ] Run full test suite and fix any failures
- [ ] Validate new SDK features are accessible

## Dev Notes
- Check breaking changes between v1.12.1 and v1.18.0
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing integrations
- Test stdio transport functionality thoroughly

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing of stdio transport
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes to API contracts
