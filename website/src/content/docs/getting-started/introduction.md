description: What is the Autotask MCP Server and how does it work?
---

The Autotask MCP Server connects AI assistants (like Claude) to your Kaseya Autotask PSA instance through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## How it works

The MCP server acts as a bridge between your AI assistant and the Autotask REST API. When you ask your AI assistant about tickets, companies, or projects, the assistant uses the MCP server's tools to query Autotask and return structured results.

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│ AI Assistant │────▶│  MCP Server  │────▶│ Autotask API │
│   (Claude)   │◀────│              │◀────│              │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```
