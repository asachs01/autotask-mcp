description: How to interact with Autotask data through natural language prompts.
---

This section shows example prompts you can use with your AI assistant to interact with Autotask data. Each example includes the prompt, what the server does behind the scenes, and the kind of output you can expect.

## How It Works

When you ask your AI assistant a question about Autotask data, the assistant:

1. Interprets your natural language request
2. Calls the appropriate MCP tool with structured parameters
3. Receives the results from the Autotask API
4. Presents the information in a readable format

## Tips for Effective Prompts

- **Be specific** — "Show me open tickets for Acme Corp" works better than "show tickets"
- **Use entity names** — Reference companies, contacts, or resources by name
- **Specify filters** — Mention status, priority, date ranges, or queues when relevant
- **Ask follow-ups** — After a search, ask for details on specific results

## Example Categories
