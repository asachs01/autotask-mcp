        "description": "Review and verify fixes for GitHub Issues #3, #8, #9 including maxRecords casing in autotask-node, search filter implementation in autotask-mcp, and create integration tests for pagination, search filters, and POST /query endpoint usage.",
        "details": "1. **Review maxRecords casing fix (Task 24)**: Confirm all 214 entity files in autotask-node/src/entities/ use 'maxRecords' (lowercase 'm') in list() methods by running grep -r 'MaxRecords' src/entities/ and verifying zero matches. Cross-reference Autotask REST API documentation to ensure parameter casing matches exactly. 2. **Verify search filter implementation in autotask-mcp service**: Review autotask-mcp service code handling search queries for contacts/companies/resources, confirm filters are applied server-side before Autotask API calls using proper query builders. Check that search uses POST /query endpoint exclusively (no GET /query or list endpoints for filtered results). 3. **Create integration test suite in tests/integration/**: Write end-to-end tests using Jest + Supertest or Playwright that: a) Test pagination with maxRecords=10, verify exactly 10 records returned and next page token works; b) Test search filters on contacts (e.g., name='John'), companies (e.g., industry='Tech'), resources (e.g., active=true) return correct filtered results; c) Verify all search/filter API calls use POST /query endpoint via network inspection or request logging; d) Create regression test cases that would have caught original Issues #3, #8, #9 (e.g., maxRecords casing mismatch returns zero results, search filters ignored, incorrect HTTP method). 4. **Documentation and commit hygiene**: Ensure all fixes have proper GitHub PRs with linked issues, comprehensive commit messages following conventional commits, and updated CHANGELOG.md. Add test README with reproduction steps for original bugs. 5. **Edge case coverage**: Test empty results, maxRecords=1, invalid filters, rate limiting scenarios.",
        "testStrategy": "1. Run grep -r 'MaxRecords' autotask-node/src/entities/ -- expect 0 matches. 2. Execute integration tests: npm run test:integration -- expect 100% pass rate covering pagination (verify record counts match maxRecords), search filters (verify filtered vs unfiltered counts differ), endpoint verification (intercept requests confirm POST /query usage). 3. Run original bug reproduction tests -- expect all to FAIL on main branch but PASS on fixed branch. 4. Verify CI/CD runs successfully with full test suite + coverage >90%. 5. Manual end-to-end test: Deploy autotask-mcp, execute CLI search/paginate commands, confirm correct behavior and API traces show proper casing/endpoint/filtering. 6. Review Git history confirms all changes properly committed with semantic messages and issue references.",
