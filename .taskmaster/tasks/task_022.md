**Title:** Design and Document Intelligent Workflow Tools Architecture

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** 6, 20

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Create comprehensive architecture design and documentation for intelligent workflow tools including Analytics, Workflows, Contextual Search, and Smart Actions with MCP elicitation support.

**Details:**

Design a modular architecture with four core components: 1) Analytics Module - Create profitability analysis engine with trend detection algorithms, high-touch customer identification using interaction frequency and value metrics, revenue attribution models, and dashboard visualization specs. 2) Workflows Module - Design onboarding automation with step-by-step customer journey mapping, escalation routing based on priority matrices and SLA requirements, intelligent ticket routing using machine learning classification. 3) Contextual Search Module - Architect customer 360-degree view aggregating data from multiple sources (tickets, interactions, billing), technician workload balancing with capacity planning and skill matching algorithms. 4) Smart Actions Module - Design MCP elicitation framework for interactive decision-making with conversation flows, decision trees, and action recommendation engine. Create detailed system diagrams showing data flow, API interfaces, database schemas, and integration points. Document microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns, event-driven communication patterns, and scalability considerations. Include security architecture with authentication, authorization, and data privacy controls.

**Test Strategy:**

Create architecture review checklist covering scalability, security, and maintainability requirements. Validate system diagrams against functional requirements. Review API specifications for completeness and consistency. Conduct stakeholder review sessions to ensure business requirements alignment. Create proof-of-concept implementations for critical components to validate architectural decisions.
